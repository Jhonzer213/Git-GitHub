                     </h1>
                    <p> GitHub is a platform that helps
                        us save Git repositories that we 
                        can use as remote servers and execute
                        some commands visually and interactively.
                        (Without the need fot the command console).
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            Blogs are the best way to share information
                            and your ideas. Much more than going to conferences
                            or appearing on YouTube. Except if youÂ´re a rockstar.
                            But statistically yoy are not... for now.
